# Web Site Redesign for artist Saint Levant. (Inspired in his new album).

This a web page made with HTML, CSS (SASS) and some JavaScript. 
Wanted to create a simple and aesthetic web experience with this project. I'm currently building the web site, but the front page of the web site it's almost done. 
Feel free to check out my project.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned new and better ways to use the view port measures for a better responsive design.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
header {
  height: 100svh;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development
The next step will be finish the other pages of the web page.
